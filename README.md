<h2>Description</h2>

This project was group output for my junior-year Computer Simulation class. As part of the course requirement, we were free to creatively use any simulation model of our choice.

Our project was well-received for its innovation, and we were subsequently invited by our professors to write a full paper and present the study at an international academic conference.

Below is the description from our final project paper:

This study explores the use of Finite State Automata (FSA) in lexicon-based sentiment analysis of Taglishâ€”a hybrid of Tagalog and English. Taglish poses a unique challenge for sentiment analysis due to the interplay between two languages. This study leverages the customizable nature of FSAs to address this complexity. The model accounts for various grammatical nuances, such as idiomatic expressions and polysemous words, to classify a sample of English and Taglish reviews into one of four categories: positive, negative, neutral, or conflicting. Through detailed analysis at each stage of development, the study demonstrates that an FSA-based approach can serve as an effective and scalable alternative to machine learning methods that currently dominate the field.
